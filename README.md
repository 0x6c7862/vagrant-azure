# Vagrant Azure Provider

![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-azure.png)

This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) 1.6.0+ plugin that adds [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to control and provision machines in Microsoft Azure.

## Usage

Install Vagrant 1.6.0 or higher - [Download Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Install the vagrant-azure plugin using the standard Vagrant 1.1+ installation methods. After installing the plugin, you can ```vagrant up``` and use ```azure``` provider. For example:

```
C:\> vagrant plugin install vagrant-azure
...
C:\> vagrant up --provider=azure
...
```

You'll need an ```azure``` box before you can do ```vagrant up``` though.

## Quick Start

You can use the dummy box and specify all the required details manually in the ```config.vm.provider``` block in your ```Vagrantfile```. Add the dummy box with the name you want:

```
C:\> vagrant box add azure https://github.com/msopentech/vagrant-azure/raw/master/dummy.box
...
```

Now edit your ```Vagrantfile``` as shown below and provide all the values as explained.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
	config.vm.box = 'azure'

	config.vm.provider :azure do |azure|
		azure.mgmt_certificate = 'YOUR AZURE MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATE'
		azure.mgmt_endpoint = 'https://management.core.windows.net'
		azure.subscription_id = 'YOUR AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID'
		azure.storage_acct_name = 'NAME OF YOUR STORAGE ACCOUNT' # optional. A new one will be generated if not provided.

		azure.vm_image = 'NAME OF THE IMAGE TO USE'
		azure.vm_user = 'PROVIDE A USERNAME' # defaults to 'vagrant' if not provided
		azure.vm_password = 'PROVIDE A VALID PASSWORD' # min 8 characters. should contain a lower case letter, an uppercase letter, a number and a special character

		azure.vm_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE' # max 15 characters. contains letters, number and hyphens. can start with letters and can end with letters and numbers
		azure.cloud_service_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR CLOUD SERVICE' # same as vm_name. leave blank to auto-generate
		azure.deployment_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR DEPLOYMENT' # defaults to cloud_service_name
		azure.vm_location = 'PROVIDE A LOCATION FOR VM' # e.g., West US
	  azure.private_key_file = 'PATH TO YOUR KEY FILE'
	  azure.certificate_file = 'PATH TO YOUR CERTIFICATE FILE'

	  # Provide the following values if creating a *Nix VM
	  azure.ssh_port = 'A VALID PUBLIC PORT'

	  # Provide the following values if creating a Windows VM
	  azure.winrm_transport = [ 'http', 'https' ] # this will open up winrm ports on both http (5985) and http (5986) ports
	  azure.winrm_https_port = 'A VALID PUBLIC PORT' # customize the winrm https port, instead of 5986
	  azure.winrm_http_port = 'A VALID PUBLIC PORT' # customize the winrm http port, insted of 5985

	  azure.tcp_endpoints = '3389:53389' # opens the Remote Desktop internal port that listens on public port 53389. Without this, you cannot RDP to a Windows VM.
	end

	config.ssh.username = 'YOUR USERNAME' # the one used to create the VM
	config.ssh.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD' # the one used to create the VM
end
```

Now you can run

```
C:\> vagrant up --provider=azure
```

This will bring up an Azure VM as per the configuration options set above.

You can now either SSH (if its a *Nix VM) using ```vagrant ssh```, RDP (if its a Windows VM) using ```vagrant rdp``` or PowerShell ```vagrant powershell```.

Normally, a lot of this options, e.g., ```vm_image```, will be embedded in a box file and you just have to provide minimal options in the ```Vagrantfile```. Since, we're using a dummy box, there are no pre-configured defaults.

## Azure Boxes

The vagrant-azure plugin provides the ability to use ```azure``` boxes with Vagrant. Please see the example box provided in [example_box/ directory](https://github.com/msopentech/vagrant-azure/tree/master/example_box) and follow the instructions there to build an ```azure``` box.

Please see [Vagrant Docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) for more details.

## Configuration

The vagrant-azure provide exposes a few Azure specific configration options:

* `mgmt_certificate` - Your Azure Management certificate which has been uploaded to the Azure portal for your account. Provide [PEM file](#pem-generation).
* `mgmt_endpoint` - Azure Management endpoint. `https://management.core.windows.net`
* `subscription_id` - Your Azure Subscription ID.
* `storage_acct_name` - The Storage account to use when creating VMs.
* `vm_user` - The username to create the VM with. Defaults to `vagrant`.
* `vm_password` - The password to set for the user created with the VM.
* `vm_image` - The name of the image to be used when creating the VM.
* `vm_name` - The name of the created VM.
* `vm_size` - The size of the created VM.
* `vm_virtual_network_name` - The name of a virtual network to connect to
* `cloud_service_name` - The name of the cloud service under which to create the VM.
* `deployment_name` - The name to give the deployment in the cloud service and add the VM to.
* `vm_location` - The location to create the cloud service, storage account.
* `private_key_file` - The private key file to use for SSH and if WinRM is enabled over HTTP/S. Provide [PEM file](#pem-generation).
* `certificate_file` - The certificate file to use for SSH and if WinRM is enabled over HTTP/S. Provide [PEM file](#pem-generation).
* `ssh_port` - To map the internal SSH port 22 to a different public port.
* `winrm_transport` - Enables or disables WinRm. Allowed values are `http` and `https`.
* `winrm_https_port` To map the internal WinRM https port 5986 to a different public port. Must be non-empty.
* `winrm_http_port` To map the internal WinRM http port 5985 to a different public port. Must be non-empty.
* `tcp_endpoints` - To open any additional ports. E.g., `80` opens port `80` and `80,3389:53389` opens port `80` and `3389`. Also maps the interal port `3389` to public port `53389`
* 

##Certificate generation
We will use `makecert.exe` distributed as part of the in the Windows 7 SDK.  The following commands will create the required certificates and insert them into the current userâ€™s personal store.

* makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha1 -n "CN=My Azure Management Certificate"
-ss My -sr CurrentUser -len 2048 -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft Enhanced RSA
and AES Cryptographic Provider" -sy 24

* makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha1 -n "CN=My Azure RDP Certificate" -ss My -sr CurrentUser -len 2048 -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" -sy 24

* makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha1 -n "CN=My Azure SSL Certificate" -ss My -sr CurrentUser -len 2048 -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" -sy 24

In order to have more details with images in Windows, access: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cclayton/archive/2012/03/21/windows-azure-and-x509-certificates.aspx

### Using openssl (Linux/Mac)
We can use [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) to generate `.pem` files:
```
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.pem
```

Use `mycert.pem` as `certificate_file` and `mycert.key` as `private_key_file`.

```
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert_mgmt.key -out mycert_mgmt.pem
```

For `mgmt_certificate` configuration, create a `mycert_mgmt.pem` using above command. Use it in your VagrantFile. Then convert the `mycert_mgmt.pem` to `mycert_mgmt.cer` to upload to azure portal. It is recommended to create different certificates for azure management and winrm.
```
$ openssl x509 -inform pem -in mycert_mgmt.pem -outform der -out mycert_mgmt.cer
```

##PEM generation
Vagrant-Azure expects you to use a .pem management certificate as shown below:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
	config.vm.box = 'azure'

	config.vm.provider :azure do |azure|
		azure.mgmt_certificate = "#{file_location_of_your_dot_pem}"
```

If you have the .crt or .cer and .key you uploaded to the azure portal, then you should be able to do the following: 

`cat mycert_mgmt.pem mycert_mgmt.key > mycert_mgmt.combined.pem`


## New Commands for `azure` provider

The `azure` provider introduces the following new `vagrant` commands.

* `rdp` - To connect to a Windows VM using RDP. E.g.,
* `powershell` - To execute remote powershell commands on a Windows VM using WinRM. 
```
> vagrant up --provider=azure
...
> vagrant rdp
...
> vagrant powershell
```


## Multi Machine
The options for multi machines are similar to Vagrant, please refer to the vagrant doc at http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/multi-machine/index.html

Example Multi Machine Vagrantfile (for building out 3 Windows Virtual Machines)

```ruby

Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  config.vm.boot_timeout = 1000

  do_common_azure_stuff = Proc.new do |azure, override|
		override.config.vm.box = 'azure'

		azure.mgmt_certificate = 'YOUR AZURE MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATE'
		azure.mgmt_endpoint = 'https://management.core.windows.net'
		azure.subscription_id = 'YOUR AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID'
		azure.storage_acct_name = 'NAME OF YOUR STORAGE ACCOUNT' # optional. A new one will be generated if not provided.

		azure.vm_image = 'NAME OF THE IMAGE TO USE'
		azure.vm_user = 'PROVIDE A USERNAME' # defaults to 'vagrant' if not provided
		azure.vm_password = 'PROVIDE A VALID PASSWORD' # min 8 characters. should contain a lower case letter, an uppercase letter, a number and a special character

		azure.vm_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE' # max 15 characters. contains letters, number and hyphens. can start with letters and can end with letters and numbers
		azure.cloud_service_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR CLOUD SERVICE' # same as vm_name. leave blank to auto-generate
		azure.deployment_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR DEPLOYMENT' # defaults to cloud_service_name
		azure.vm_location = 'PROVIDE A LOCATION FOR VM' # e.g., West US

		azure.winrm_transport = %w(https)
  end

  config.vm.define 'first' do |cfg|
    config.vm.provider :azure do |azure, override|
      do_common_azure_stuff.call azure, override
      azure.vm_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE'
      azure.tcp_endpoints = '3389:53389' # opens the Remote Desktop internal port that listens on public port 53389. Without this, you cannot RDP to a Windows VM.
      azure.winrm_https_port = 5986
    end
  end

  config.vm.define 'second' do |cfg|
    cfg.vm.provider :azure do |azure, override|
      do_common_azure_stuff.call azure, override
      azure.vm_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE'
      azure.tcp_endpoints = '3389:53390'
      azure.winrm_https_port = 5987
    end
  end

  config.vm.define 'third' do |cfg|
    cfg.vm.provider :azure do |azure, override|
      do_common_azure_stuff.call azure, override
      azure.vm_name = 'PROVIDE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE'
      azure.tcp_endpoints = '3389:53391'
      azure.winrm_https_port = 5988
    end
  end

  # Executes powershell on the remote machine and returns the hostname
  config.vm.provision 'shell', inline: 'hostname'

end

```
